If you are absolutely certain what you are doing, access the internal storage via `InMemoryDataset._data` instead to suppress this warning. Alternatively, you can access stacked individual attributes of every graph via `dataset.{attr_name}`.

torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 6.02 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.57 GiB of which 5.82 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 17.74 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 7.80 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 9.63 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
